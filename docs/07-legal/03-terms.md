         In these SFPY General Terms of Use (“<strong>Terms</strong>”), “<strong>SFPY</strong>”, "<strong>we</strong>" and "<strong>us</strong>" refers to a blockchain development collective who own and operate the website https://sfpy.co ("the <strong>Site</strong>")
         <p>
            The Site provides access to a decentralized protocol on the public Ethereum blockchain that allows users to transact (buy and sell) with each other using certain digital assets (”the <strong>SFPY Protocol</strong>”). The Site is a front-end (website-hosted user interface) to the SFPY Protocol. The SFPY Protocol consists of open-source or source-available software running on the public Ethereum blockchain. The Site also provides access to other features, tools, materials, or services offered from time to time, including our network infrastructure, by us or our affiliates (together with the Site, the SFPY Protocol, we refer to these  as the “<strong>SFPY Services</strong>”).
         </p>
         <p>
            These Terms apply to you (“<strong>You</strong>”) as a user of the SFPY services. You represent that you are at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction (e.g., eighteen years old) and have the full right, power, and authority to enter into and comply with these Terms on behalf of yourself and any company or legal entity for which you may access or use any of the SFPY Services. 
         </p>
         <p>
            You must read these Terms carefully. By accessing or using the SFPY Services, you signify that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by this Agreement in its entirety. If you do not agree, you are not authorized to, and should not use, the SFPY Services. By using the SFPY Services in any capacity, you agree that you have read and understood these Terms.
         </p>
         <p>
            The SFPY Services are only available to you—and you should only access the SFPY Services—if you agree completely with the Terms.
         </p>
         <p>
            You are advised to check these Terms periodically to familiarise yourself with any changes to the Terms. SFPY in its sole discretion, reserves the right to make changes to our terms of services. Changes are binding on users of the SFPY Services and will take effect immediately upon posting. As a user, you agree to be bound by any changes, variations, or modifications to our terms of service and your continued use of the SFPY Services shall constitute acceptance of any such changes, variations, or modifications.
         </p>
         <p>
            SFPY will indicate on the Site of the changes to these Terms. You accept by doing so, we provide you with sufficient notice of such change.

         As part of the Site, SFPY provides access to a decentralized application (“<strong>Application</strong>”) on the Ethereum blockchain, that allows users of Ethereum assets (“<strong>Cryptocurrency assets</strong>”) to transact using smart contracts (“<strong>Smart Contracts</strong>”).
         <p>
            Using the SFPY Services may require that you pay a fee, such as gas charges on the Ethereum network to perform a transaction. You acknowledge and agree that SFPY has no control over any transactions, the method of payment of any transactions, or any actual payments of transactions. You must ensure that you have a sufficient balance to complete any transaction on the SFPY Protocol before initiating such transaction.

            You acknowledge and agree that SFPY has no control over any transactions over the SFPY Protocol, the method of payment of any transactions or any actual payments of transactions.
