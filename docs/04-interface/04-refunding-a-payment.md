Payments can be easily refunded back to the payer by burning liquidity tokens and sending the underlying token back to the recipient. Merchants must ensure that they have the requisite amount held in their liquidity pool to complete a refund. If the amount in the liquidity pool is not enough to cover the refund, merchants can send the amount back to the payee using their own self hosted wallets.
